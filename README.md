# Web can be fun!

Web APIs is capable of way more than we might think. There are so many unusual Web APIs to explore. We'll explore parts
of the web that we might not know before. Did you know you can send Bluetooth signal directly to the web? or did you
know you can control web by using synthesizer via Web MIDI? In this session, we will play something fun together, by
controlling my jacket, and synthesizer, and explore ranges of strange Web APIs.
